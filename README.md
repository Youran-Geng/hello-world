My first use of GitHub. 

## Some Use of Markdown (subtitle)
I am used with **Bear** ~~as a substitute for Apple's Notes app~~, which is an app heavily lied on Markdown language. 
Some markdown still works, such as [A link to Bilibili](www.bilibili.com). 
> "The game is on." -- Sherlock Holmes

To play gamess: 
1. do something
2. watch Detective Sherlock
- [ ] Try to beat Moriarty
* You win! 

`code works.`
```
cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
```
Code block works.

However, ::mark does not work.::
